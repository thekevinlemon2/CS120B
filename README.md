CS120B Final Project: Jukebox 

Overview:
The project consisted of creating a simple jukebox where the user could select a song and play it. The jukebox has an LCD for song selections, a speaker for audio output, festive lights to go with the music, as well as buttons for user input.

How To:
Simply power on the jukebox. The LCD will display instructions for you to scroll through the songs via arrow buttons. Once you have found the desired song, press the play button. The song will play and during this time the LCD will display the song title and the LEDS will light up to the notes. While the song is playing you can either press stop or hold down the fast forward button to play at 2x speed. Stopping the song or letting it finish takes you back to the selection menu where you can repeat the proccess. Enjoy!
